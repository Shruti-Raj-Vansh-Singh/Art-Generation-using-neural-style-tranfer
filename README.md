# Art-Generation-using-neural-style-tranfer

Neural style tranfer can be used to generate an output image that has the based on the stuff showed in the, what we call, the content image but has the styling and feel of the style image. 
#### You can now know how would it look if Leonardo Di Vinci had nade your painting insteasd of Mona Lisa!

This technique basically exploits the way in which layers at different depths of a CNN extract features. The initial layers look at simpler features like edges, or maybe colors, etc and as we go deeper into the network the layers it tries to look at more complex features like texture, shapes and maybe complete objects too. So we can say that the initial layers give us the content and the later ones give us the style of the image and that is exactly we actually need!!
